This is a webapp that uses IBM Granite. The Model is hosted on the computer that will be running the program so ensure your computer is up to the task or use google colab to run it.
To run the program on a windows pc, make sure the file "main.py" , "requirements.txt" , "run.bat" are in the same folder nad then simply double click the run.bat file to execute.
